This Task1 folder contains 3 parts :
**(1-1) Deep vs Shallow**
1. Simulate a function:
(i)function need to be single-input, single-output
(ii)function need to be non-linear
2. Train on actual task:
(i)MNIST or CIFAR-10

**(1-2) Optimization**
1. Three subtask
(i)Visualize the optimization process.
(ii)Observe gradient norm during training.
(iii)What happens when gradient is almost zero?
2. Train on designed function, MNIST or CIFAR-10

**(1-3) Generalization**
1. Three subtask
Ii) Can network fit random labels?
(ii) Number of parameters v.s. Generalization
(iii) Flatness v.s. Generalization
2. Train on MNIST or CIFAR-10

I used Google Colab and Palmetto for writing the code and training the models.
Clone or download the files, upload in the Google Colab and run the file.
